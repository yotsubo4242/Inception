General guidelines
• This project needs to be done on a Virtual Machine.
• All the files required for the configuration of your project must be placed in a srcs
folder.
• A Makefile is also required and must be located at the root of your directory. It
must set up your entire application (i.e., it has to build the Docker images using
docker-compose.yml).
• This subject requires putting into practice concepts that, depending on your background, you may not have learned yet. Therefore, we advise you not to hesitate to
read a lot of documentation related to Docker usage, as well as anything else you
will find helpful in order to complete this assignment.
Mandatory part
This project consists of having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different
services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You
have to use docker compose.
Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service.
Each service has to run in a dedicated container.
For performance reasons, the containers must be built either from the penultimate stable
version of Alpine or Debian. The choice is yours.
You also have to write your own Dockerfiles, one per service. The Dockerfiles must
be called in your docker-compose.yml by your Makefile.
This means you have to build the Docker images of your project yourself. It is then
forbidden to pull ready-made Docker images, as well as using services such as DockerHub
(Alpine/Debian being excluded from this rule).
You then have to set up:
• A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
• A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and
configured) only, without nginx.
• A Docker container that contains MariaDB only, without nginx.
• A volume that contains your WordPress database.
• A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
• You must use Docker named volumes for these two persistent storages. Bind
mounts are not allowed for these volumes.
• Both named volumes must store their data inside /home/login/data on the host
machine. Replace "login" with your learner’s username.
• A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.
A Docker container is not a virtual machine. Thus, it is not
recommended to use any hacky patches based on ’tail -f’ and similar
methods when trying to run it. Read about how daemons work and
whether it’s a good idea to use them or not.
Of course, using network: host or --link or links: is forbidden.
The network line must be present in your docker-compose.yml file.
Your containers must not be started with a command running an
infinite loop. Thus, this also applies to any command used as
entrypoint, or used in entrypoint scripts. The following are a
few prohibited hacky patches: tail -f, bash, sleep infinity, while
true.
Read about PID 1 and the best practices for writing Dockerfiles.
• In your WordPress database, there must be two users, one of them being the administrator. The administrator’s username can’t contain admin/Admin or administrator/Administrator (e.g., admin, administrator, Administrator, admin-123, and
so forth).
Your volumes will be available in the /home/login/data folder of the
host machine using Docker. Of course, you have to replace the login
with yours.
To make things simpler, you have to configure your domain name so it points to your
local IP address.
This domain name must be login.42.fr. Again, you have to use your own login.
For example, if your login is wil, wil.42.fr will redirect to the IP address pointing to
wil’s website.
The latest tag is prohibited.
No password must be present in your Dockerfiles.
It is mandatory to use environment variables.
Also, it is mandatory to use a .env file to store environment
variables. It is strongly recommended that you use Docker secrets to
store any confidential information. Any credentials, API keys,
or passwords found in your Git repository (outside of properly
configured secrets) will result in project failure.
Your NGINX container must be the only entrypoint into your
infrastructure via the port 443 only, using the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3
protocol.

For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, passwords,
etc., must be saved locally in various ways/files and ignored by git.
Publicly stored credentials will lead you directly to a failure of
the project.
You can store your variables (as a domain name) in an environment
variable file like .env
